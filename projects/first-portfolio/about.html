						My name is Bryan Tran, I am 19 years young, I am Asian, my height is 5'7'', Black hair (but I dye it brown a lot), dark brown eyes, and I have really thick hair. I was born in a place called Beaumont, Texas. Although I was born there I moved when I was around 2 or 3 to live in where I am now Dallas, Texas. I was raised here for a long time, went to elementary, middle, and high school all within 5 miles of each other! Currently I am attending the University of Texas at Dallas and majoring in Computer Science (Possibly switching to Software Engineering).</p>

						<p>
						Let's talk about what I like and what I enjoy doing! I enjoy hanging out with friends, meeting new people, talking to people, and just have fun joking around. I love playing videos games, binge watching netflix shows, going out to the movies, practicing artwork, and as well as working on programming related materials!</p>

						<p>
						Fun fact: I was a semi-professional Overwatch player (famous video game), I temporarily played for a team until I decided school is something I wanted to prioritize! I am currently a 3x Top 500 player on that game! Definitely my favorite game.	</p> </div>

						<h3>What I do</h3>
						<div class="dark"> <p> Currently since I am a full-time student, I focus mostly on school work and working on side projects. For example this website would be something I did as a side-project and as well as something I did for fun. I mostly work on Java and C++. Most of my projects are done in Java. My github will be linked and you should go and visit to see my works! I have done works on APIs and GUIs. I am currently working on an Android App which utilizes APIs and hopefully you'll get to see it! If you would like to work with me just head to my contact page and shoot me an email and we can work together!</p> </div>
