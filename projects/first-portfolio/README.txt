This is a personal website I made for fun on the side. Followed a few tutorials, looked up how to do other stuff. I currently do not own a domain site but if you want to check it out, go ahead and download the file and feel free to roam around!

It's functional and resizes itself for when you're using mobile devices or when you're decreasing the size of web browser.
Was super fun to make this and I'm really happy. It is 98% finished, I need to change some pictures and do some resizing on the showcase but other than that it's done.
